This is Project 1 for CS150. The goal of this project is to test implementations 
of 5 sorting methods for different sizes of input, in order to observe performance
and speed of each method. The methods being tested are:
Selection sort
Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort: 3 pivot choices (first, median and top)
